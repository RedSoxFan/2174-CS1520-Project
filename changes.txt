For the second project, I did the following:
- Changed static HTML files to PHP files
- Changed to using header and footer includes
- Added content to projects.php
- Added backend for contact.php (process.php) to store in a database
- Added javascript to contact.php for errors
- Added .htaccess and rewrite rules for clean URLs
